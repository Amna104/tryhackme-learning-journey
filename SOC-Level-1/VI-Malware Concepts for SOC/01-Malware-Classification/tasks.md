# 🛡️ TryHackMe — Malware Analysis Essentials  

**Objective:** Understand malware types, their behaviour, and how SOC analysts classify and respond to them.  
**Duration:** ~60 min  
**Focus:** Real-world examples, binary vs script malware, and practical classification exercises.  

---

## 🧩 Task 1 — Introduction  

**Overview:**  
- Malware: software/code designed to **damage systems, steal information, or allow unauthorized access**.  
- Impacts: financial loss, data theft, service disruption, reputational damage.  
- SOC Analysts: detect and respond to suspicious activity, classify malware to determine proper response (e.g., isolate machines, investigate data theft).  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Classify malware by **behaviour and purpose**.  
- Understand real-world malware operations.  
- Identify differences between **binary and script-based malware**.  
- Practice classifying malware types.

## 🧩 Task 3 — Real-World Malware Examples  

**Malware Families & Case Studies:**  

| Type | Case Study | Behaviour | MITRE ATT&CK |
|------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Spyware | Pegasus | Targets mobile phones, collects SMS, location, emails, mic/cam recordings | TA0009 (Collection), TA0010 (Exfiltration) |
| Ransomware | Akira | Encrypts files, demands cryptocurrency, threatens data leaks | TA0040 (Impact), TA0011 (C2) |
| Wiper | Shamoon | Overwrites files, disrupts entire networks | TA0040 (Impact) |
| Data Stealer | Agent Tesla | Phishing-delivered, steals keystrokes, credentials | TA0010 (Exfiltration) |
| Keylogger | RedLine Stealer | Captures keystrokes, cookies, crypto wallets | TA0006 (Credential Access), TA0010 (Exfiltration) |
| C2 RAT | QakBot (QBot) | Modular RAT for banking, credential theft, ransomware loader | TA0011 (C2), TA0002 (Execution), TA0006 (Credential Access) |

**Notes:**  
- Malware families group programs with similar origin or codebase.  
- Familiarity with real incidents improves detection and response.

## 🧩 Task 4 — Binary vs Script Malware  

**Binary Malware (Executables):**  
- Compiled files like `.exe` or `.dll`.  
- Delivered via email attachments, malicious downloads, or removable media.  
- Often disguised with misleading icons or extensions.  
- Identification: checksum/hash (e.g., `md5sum`) or unique byte sequences.  

**Script-Based Malware:**  
- Written in **JavaScript, VBScript, batch files, or PowerShell**.  
- Delivery: email attachments with macros, malicious websites.  
- Advantages: easy to modify, memory-only execution.  
- Warning signs: downloads/runs files from the internet, disables security tools, executes unusual commands, launches other apps.
